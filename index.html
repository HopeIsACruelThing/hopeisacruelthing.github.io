Personal site of a regular dude that usually goes by Infi around the internet
but is also known as WillingToLearn here and there (excluding Github -- that is
not me).

Interested in a plethora of things but this site is mostly going to be a shrine
for my personal interests, particularly in subcultures associated with Japan
like vtubers, anime and managa, learning Japanese etc. I am a big fan of Minato
Aqua, Murasaki Shion and Sakamata Chloe in particular so you can expect this
place to be a shrine of sorts for them.

Elsewhere I play Granblue Fantasy too seriously for my own good. Also a
techie. Also interested in literature proper.  Hence I might also blog about
these topics though I generally like to keep different interests separate where
possible for the benefit of the people who may happen by. I have been
rethinking that approach in favor of a holistic online presence but I am not
sure yet.
